## Coderpad
The mission of the project is to provide an interactive coding editor for developers.

### To start development:
#### 1. Clone the project.
#### 2. Enter the project directory and make sure the coderpad-client has been pulled as well. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` subsequently.
#### 3. To run the client, go into the coderpad-client project root and run `npm install` and then `npm start`. The frontend will be deployed to `localhost:3000` by default.
#### 4. To run the server, go into the executor project root and run `python3 executor_server.py`. The backend will be deployed to `localhost:5000` by default.
